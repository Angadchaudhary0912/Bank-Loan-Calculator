Project title: bank loan calculator












	Abstract 
The Bank Loan Calculator is a simple C program that calculates the Equated Monthly Installment (EMI) for a bank loan. The user inputs the loan amount, annual interest rate, and loan duration in years, and the program outputs the monthly EMI, total payment, and total interest.
This project demonstrates modular programming, separating code into functions, header files, and source files, making it organized and maintainable. It provides a user-friendly console application to plan loan repayments efficiently.









	Problem Definition
Calculating EMI manually can be time-consuming and error-prone, especially for varying loan amounts, durations, and interest rates.
Problem Statement:
Develop a program that can:
	Take loan amount, interest rate, and loan duration as input.
	Calculate monthly EMI, total amount payable, and total interest.
	Display the results clearly in the console for the user.









3. System Design (Flowcharts & Algorithms)
Algorithm
	Start the program.
	Input loan amount, annual interest rate, and loan duration in years.
	Calculate monthly interest rate: R = annual_rate / 12 / 100.
	Calculate total number of months: N = years × 12.
	Calculate EMI using the formula:
EMI=(P⋅R⋅(1+R)^N)/((1+R)^N-1)

	Calculate total payment: total_payment = EMI × N.
	Calculate total interest: total_interest = total_payment - P.
	Display the results.
	End program.

    float R = annual_rate / 12 / 100;

Main Program (main.c)

#include <stdio.h>
#include "loan.h"

int main() {

    scanf("%f", &P);

    printf("Enter Annual Interest Rate (in %%): ");
    scanf("%f", &annual_rate);

    printf("Enter Loan Duration (in years): ");
    scanf("%d", &years);

    EMI = calculateEMI(P, annual_rate, years);

}

	 Testing & Results

Input:
Loan Amount: 100000
Annual Interest Rate: 10%
Loan Duration: 5 years
Output:
Monthly EMI: 2124.70
Total Amount Payable: 127482.00
Total Interest Paid: 27482.00











	 Conclusion & Future Work

Conclusion:
The Bank Loan Calculator accurately calculates EMI, total payment, and interest for any loan. The project demonstrates C programming concepts such as functions, header files, and modular programming, and provides a simple console-based application.
Future Work:
	Support for different types of loans (home, personal, car) with varying interest rules.
	Develop a GUI-based version for easier use.
	Add file saving/loading of loan records.
